      <h2>Testimonials</h2>
      <p>"Selling our home with Tony was a positive and smooth experience. From the initial listing, to open houses, to closing, it was evident that Tony was extremely knowledgeable and passionate about real estate. I appreciate his great attention to detail and how he always makes time for his clients. I   highly recommend Tony Ma for any of your real estate needs!" - Sally Zhen</p>
      <p>"Tony is THE BEST! As a first time homebuyer, I was nervous to begin my search but Tony helped me learn more about what I wanted (and more importantly, what I didn't!) and helped me find the perfect home. Throughout the process, Tony explained everything clearly to make sure I was up to speed and on the same page.." - Cassie Curtin</p>
